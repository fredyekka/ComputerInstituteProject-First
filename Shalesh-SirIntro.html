            <b><br><i><h2>Dear Everyone,</h2></i></b></br>  
        <h3>It is my privilege to write a short message for the Website of VG Tech institute, Moradabad.</h3>
        <div class="i"></div>
        <br><h3><i>"I quote with the words of Jawaharlal Nehru, "Children are like buds in the garden that need to be carefully nurtured, as they are the future citizens of tomorrow. 
        Education acts as the wind beneath the wings for children to grow as healthy and prosperous adults in the future".</i></br>
        <br>It is with a great pleasure, I welcome you all to the new academic year.Quest for knowledge is unending Education plays a significant role to unlock the success of a child The day you stop seeking knowledge, is the day you stop growing. 
        It is a proud moment for this institution as you are entering to the system of learning process in this year. 
        As you all know modern education does not just only focus on the prominent academic disciplines,
        but it also aims to foster critical thinking life skills value education and decision making skills in students.</br>
        Our task is to make it possible and our mission is to provide a platform for the same.
        Today VG institution has grown up as an excellent institution to help students to achieve their educational carrier and personal goals. 
        I take the occasion to congratulate the Principal, Staffs, Students and Parents for their sense of commitment and responsibilities 
        that has transformed this institution into an outstanding and significant temple of learning.
        <br></b>
        <br>I pray that almighty God continues to bless the school as well as the members of the VG's family.
        let us remember the words of Mahatma Gandhi "Live as if you were to die tomorrow, learn as if you were to live forever" 
        We live in a world that is amazingly fast, instant and with high-speed exchange of information and knowledge. 
        The time will fly on its own pace. We have to be fully immersed and alert to grab the opportunities open to each one of us.
